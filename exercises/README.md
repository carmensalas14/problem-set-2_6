# Problem Set 2.6
## Introduction to JavaScript Objects

**1. Write a function, `log` that will log each property and corresponding value of an object, separated by a colon.**
    ```javascript
    const attributes = {
      speed: 90,
      power: 95,
      accuracy: 79,
      defense: 82,
    }

    log(attributes);
    // speed: 90
    // power: 95
    // accuracy: 79
    // defense: 82
    ```

**2. Write a function called `totalProps` that will return the total number of properties for a given object (not including prototype properties).**
    ```javascript
    const grades = {
      A: 100,
      B: 92,
      C: 84,
      D: 76,
      F: 64,
    }

    totalProps(grades); // 5
    ```

**3. Write a function called `listBooks` that takes an array of book objects and logs a sentence about the `title` and `author` for each book.**
    ```javascript
    const library = [ 
    {
        author: 'Bill Gates',
        title: 'The Road Ahead',
        readingStatus: true
    },
    {
        author: 'Walter Isaacson',
        title: 'Steve Jobs,
        readingStatus: true
    },
    {
        author: 'Suzanne Collins',
        title:  'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games', 
        readingStatus: false
    }];

    listBooks(library);
    // "The Road Ahead was written by Bill Gates."
    // "Steve Jobs was written by Walter Isaacson."
    // "Mockingjay: The Final Book of the Hunger Games was written by Suzanne Collins."
    ```

**4. Implement a function called `repeatedCharacters` that takes a String as an argument and returns an object that contains a count of the repeated characters.**
    ```javascript
    repeatedCharacters('Programming');    // { r: 2, g: 2, m: 2 }
    repeatedCharacters('Combination');    // { o: 2, i: 2, n: 2 }
    repeatedCharacters('Pet');            // {}
    repeatedCharacters('Paper');          // { p: 2 }
    repeatedCharacters('Baseless');       // { s: 3, e: 2 }
    ```
